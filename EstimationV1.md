Version: 1

# Estimation approach

Consider the EZElectronics project in CURRENT version (as given by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course, and from scratch

# Estimate by size

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NC = Estimated number of classes to be developed                                                        | 10       |
| A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC                                                            | 150      |
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC \* A)                                                       | 1500     |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)                    | 150      |
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro)                                     | 4500 â‚¬   |
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | ~ 1 week |

E = 1500 / 10 = 37.5

Estimated calendar time:

**E = 150 person/hour -> 37,5 hours per person -> 4 days and 4h per person ~ 1 week**
